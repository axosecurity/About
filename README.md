# 5 Why you should hire me ? as a web-researcher


In the field of cybersecurity information is power more information you have about the target more vulnerability you can find that's why every hacker is an expert in Web research we find various confidential information about the target using OSINT
OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) refers to the collection and analysis of publicly available information, such as news articles, social media posts, and government records, to gather intelligence and insights. This information is used to support decision-making processes, inform security strategies, and identify potential threats.
Also, i followed Intelligent cyclel for collection of information for my Project 
The INTELLIGENT CYCLE  refers to the process of gathering, analyzing, and disseminating information to support decision-making and action. It involves the following steps:
1:Planning and Direction: Defining intelligence requirements and setting goals
2:Collection: Gathering information from various sources
3:Processing: Organizing and preparing the collected information for analysis
4:Analysis: Examining the information to identify patterns, trends, and insights
5:Dissemination: Sharing the analyzed information with stakeholders to inform decision-making and action
6:Feedback: Use feedback to evaluate the effectiveness of the intelligence cycle and make improvements.
All law enforcement forces follow this cycle that's why they can generate the best quality report against the target 
I Pray and hope that you will like my military-grade web research report and this will help your organization in their project

# 8 how i become ethical hacker 

I began my cybersecurity journey with a thirst for knowledge and a determination to succeed. After passing my 5 exams, I came across a video on Termux and was immediately drawn to the world of hacking. Despite not having a phone, I had computer skills and an Android TV, so I started learning the basics of Linux using my TV, but with limited time due to family members using the TV for entertainment. However, I was not discouraged, and I took the time to write down the commands I learned in a notebook so I could refer to them later.

After completing Class 8, I invested in a second-hand computer with an i3 6100 processor and 4 GB of RAM, which became my tool for learning ethical hacking. Despite the various real-life challenges I faced, including a nose and tonsil operation in Class 6, I continued to push forward and deepen my knowledge. I relied on YouTube and Google as my primary sources of learning, and through my hard work and dedication, I was able to turn my passion for cybersecurity into a successful career as an ethical hacker.

This journey was not easy, and there were times when I felt like giving up. But my love for cybersecurity and my determination to succeed kept me going. Now, I am proud to be a successful ethical hacker, and I am eager to share my story with others as a source of inspiration and motivation.
